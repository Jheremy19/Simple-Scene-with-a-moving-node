Week 2 : Activity 2 Level Design (add this in readme.md)
Tilemaps for grid-based levels, adding hazards (spikes/traps), designing flow (pacing, difficulty curves). 
Activity : Design of 2 levels for an endless runner (2D or 3D); Level 1 should be noticeable easier than level 2. Implement traps. No HP, once caught in trap restart from the beginning of the level. There should be a notification when entering level 2.
